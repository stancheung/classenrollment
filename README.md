This is a simple class enrollment system that I created for my last workplace - Kizuna Climbing. I have been working there for about a year, and I have to say the flow of enrolling new customers into our Climbing Classes was a mess. I needed to chat with customers on WhatsApp, ask for their info, type the info on Google Spreadsheet. If there is any changes, I have to modify the Google Spreadsheet and inform the customers. Customers always forget what upcoming classes they have so they will ask us, and we will need to check the dazzling spreadsheet again.
I planned to work in the IT industry instead so I quit my job at the climbing gym. Before I left, I thought it would be a good idea to try making a Class Enrollment System that handles customers profiles, classes available, enrollments records etc. And this would be a great start for my journey to maybe becoming a Web Dev in the future.
