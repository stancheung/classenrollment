This is a simple class enrollment system that I created for my last workplace - Kizuna Climbing. 
I have been working there for about a year, and the workflow of enrolling customers into classes was a mess. 
I needed to manually handle requests from WhatsApp and manageed booking on Google Spreadsheet. I had to do everything using the dazzling Google Spreadsheet.
I quit my job at the climbing gym because I planned to work in the IT industry.
Before I left, I thought it would be a good idea to try making a Class Enrollment System that handles customers profiles, classes available, enrollments records etc. 
And this would be a great start for my journey to maybe becoming a Web Dev in the future.
